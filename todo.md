# Todo
- [ ] default to using /etc/nemini for config
- [ ] default to using /etc/nemini/certs for certificates (unless otherwise stated)
- [ ] allow for multiple sites to be served on the same port... at the loss of certificate validity
- [ ] create install.sh file for easy install of binary and config dirs
- [ ] PKGBUILD
- [ ] look into other packaging
